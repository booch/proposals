We Can Splat if we Want to
==========================

Track: Weird Ruby

Audience: Beginner/Intermediate


Abstract (public, 600 characters)
--------

Ruby is a language we all love. It has an elegance and aesthetic
that is rivaled by few. The more we learn about the language, the
deeper our love becomes. But there are some areas of Ruby that are
relatively unexplored. Learning one of these corners can
open up a whole new world of ideas. Let's dive into one corner and
learn how we can emulate some basic pattern matching, like that found
in other languages. You just might change some of your current code.


Details (outlines, outcomes, intended audience, etc.)
-------

I would like beginner and intermediate developers to gain an
appreciation for splat and double splat operators and start thinking
of uses of implicit and explicit conversions and how to utilize them.

I'll start with the basics of the splat operator used in assignments,
blocks, and arguments. Most beginners know to use the splat at the
end of an argument list as a variable argument list, so we will start
there. Then I will show the different positions within the argument list
where splat can be used for a simplified pattern matching.

We will then continue on to splatting out an array into
arguments to show that we can go both ways. As part of showing the usage
of splat in arguments we will implement `car` and `cdr` as well as the
infinite expansion of those just like Lisp (`cadr`, `caaddar`, etc.).

After a few examples of using splat with arguments, I will show that
using the use of an assignment statement using a splat on the left hand side.

Moving to the right hand side of the assignment operator splat, we
will start to learn about implicit vs explicit conversion. I will
show both `to_a` and `to_ary` on the same object. I will expand this
explanation to the double splat to include `to_h` and `to_hash`.
We will then see what the difference are in there implicit vs.
explicit use cases.

Now that the audience is thinking about implicit vs explicit conversions
I plan to show a complete list of Ruby's methods for doing this as
well as some quick examples.

I hope that this introduction will encourage the use and exploration
of conversions in order to maximize the usefulness of objects with
less code.


Pitch (why this talk, why me?)
-----

Splat is a Ruby operator that is simple to understand but underutilized.
I believe this a good place to start to step past the beauty of
Enumerable and really appreciate the language. Using splat touches
on implicit and explicit conversions that can be introduced to the
less seasoned Rubyists. There has been a big push recently towards
functional styles and languages that support pattern matching.
Although it doesn't get us all the way there, the splat does lead us
to a form of poor person's pattern matching. I believe that learning this
simple and elegant operator opens up a new world of possibilities for
playing and growing.

I've been writing Ruby since 2005 and Rails since 2006. I took over
the local Ruby group in 2011 so I could give more to the community.

I love Ruby because of its power and elegance, but as a consultant I
often find a lack of the beauty in simplicity being underutilized and
unknown. I want to start to help people grow in understanding the
advantages that Ruby has to offer.

I've done some research on conversions and on splat itself. There are
some good articles out there, but I'm surprised that there is not an
emphasis on how this can lead to more intention-revealing code that
isn't muddled up in the details.

I've spoken many times at local user groups and it leads to many people
asking for help or thanking me later. I want to bring these lessons to a
wider audience and become more involved in the community that has given
me so much.
